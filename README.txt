College Applicant Classifier

Description: A local college here in California wants to save money by partially automating its applicant review process. In short:

1) Some applicants can be accepted without further review by admissions staff (“instant accept”).
2) Other applicants can be safely rejected without further review by admissions staff (“instant reject”).
3) The remaining applicants need “further review” by admissions staff, because they’re not an “instant accept” nor an “instant reject.”
